Proxmox tips:
Binding/mount storage
Add this line to LXC.conf in /etc/pve/lxc/
mp<1,2,3,4...>: /host/path/to/folder, mp=/lxc/path/to/folder/
Must first add storage in Proxmox GUI. Datacenter->Storage->Add

Permissions:
Must create group that shares PGID amongst all LXCs to be able to share a folder
commands: chmod, chown, ls -l, groupadd, useradd
rwm = read, write, modify
chmod 777 path/folder // give full access to everyone

Docker compose tips
To run container network through another container network, use: 
network_mode: "name of container service"
useful for running through a VPN or firewall
